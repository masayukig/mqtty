# This is the query used for the list of changes when a project is
# selected.  The default is "status:open". If you don't want to see
# changes which are WIP or have verification failures, use a query like this:
# change-list-query: "status:open not label:Workflow=-1"

# If you also want to exclude reviews with failed tests, the query is slightly

# "status:open not (label:Workflow=-1 or label:Verified=-1)"
