Mqtty
=====

Mqtty is a console-based interface to the MQTT server

As compared to the web interface, the main advantages are:

 * Workflow -- the interface is designed to support a workflow similar
   to reading network news or mail.  In particular, it is designed to
   deal with a large number of stories across a large number of
   projects.

 * Offline Use -- Mqtty syncs information about changes in
   subscribed projects to a local database.

 * Speed -- user actions modify locally cached content and need not
   wait for server interaction.
